## About Me ##
My name is Kristine Christensen. I am a lifelong learner who enjoys the challenge of learning new things. I like to weld, create art, and travel. I am also interested in learning more about coding and am looking forward to being able to transfer what I learn in this class into my classroom instruction. 

## Past Coding Experience ##
I have some experience with C++ and Java (ugh) but I'm very rusty and out of practice. I do have some HTML and CSS experience but it is very outdated and needs a complete refreshining. 

## Career Goals ##
I am pretty set in my career and do not anticipate changing anything but you never know. Part of my career goals is to keep learning so I would include the following in my goals:
1. Complete the coursework towards attaining my MA in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Web Design from University of Florida
2. Complete my coursework in cybersecurity at Georgia Tech. 
    1. Pass the Security+ Exam
    2. Study for the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification
3. Complete my Emergency Management Certificate
